- Pattern 1: Sliding Window
- Pattern 2: Two Pointers
- Pattern 3: Fast & Slow Pointers
- Pattern 4: Merge Intervals
- Pattern 5: Cyclic Sort
- Pattern 6: In-place Reversal of a LinkedList
- Pattern 7: Tree Breadth First Search
- Pattern 8: Tree Depth First Search
- Pattern 9: Two Heaps
- Pattern 10: Subsets
- Pattern 11: Modified Binary Search
- Pattern 12: Bitwise XOR
- Pattern 13: Top _K_ Elements
- Pattern 14: K-way merge
